# OpenSourceBypasser
This is a chat bypasser for roblox that works on any executor and is opensource!

LocalScript Shortened: loadstring(game:HttpGet('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/denisexploitsandother/OpenSourceBypasser/prerelease/bypasserprerelease'))()

This uses a light ui libary and its not obfuscated so u can modify anything 
but dont use the same name.

# Note
This is a broken release branch that was planned to work with TextChatService And ClassicTextChatService
but it never got here cuz it was Broken.
Improve this branch by fixing the code!
