# OpenSourceBypasser
This is a chat bypasser for roblox that works on any executor and is opensource!

LocalScript Shortened: loadstring(game:HttpGet('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/denisexploitsandother/OpenSourceBypasser/main/bypassermain'))()

This uses a light ui libary and its not obfuscated so u can modify anything 
but dont use the same name.

# Note
This does only work on LegacyTextChatService because we didnt add support for TextChatService yet.
