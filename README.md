# OpenSourceBypasser
This is a chat bypasser for roblox that works on any executor and is opensource!

LoadString Shortened: loadstring(game:HttpGet('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/denisexploitsandother/OpenSourceBypasser/main/bypassermain'))()

This uses a light ui libary and its not obfuscated so u can modify anything 
but dont use the same name.

# Note
The TextChatService support is broken. please wait until we fix it.
If u want to fix it ur self. then Check out Prerelease branch. we have the textchatservice model there.
